# Coding workflow preferences

- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do no touch code that is unreleated the task
- Write thorough test for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has show to work well, unless explicity structed
- Always think about what other methods an areas of code might be affected by code changes
